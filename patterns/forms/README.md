These forms are used to gather information from potential dog adopters.

- The basic form is simple and easy to understand. The basic form is used on the application page to begin the process of adopting a dog.
- The icon form gathers the name, e-mail of the user and a comment/question on the home page. It is decorated more then the basic form because it is small. It can be used for any small form.
